# BPMN Review Skill

Activate when user:
- Asks about a `.bpmn` file
- Edits or adds a BPMN workflow
- Requests a process review
- Mentions service tasks, message events, or workflows

## Analysis Steps

1. **Read the BPMN file** and identify:
   - Service tasks and their types (`zeebe:taskDefinition`)
   - Message events and correlation keys
   - User tasks
   - Error boundary events

2. **Check compliance with PATTERNS.md**:
   - Do service task types follow `name:version` format?
   - Are element IDs descriptive (not auto-generated)?
   - Do message events have correlation keys?

3. **Check compliance with .NET code**:
   - Do handlers exist for all service tasks?
   - Search for classes with `[JobWorker(Type = "...")]` attribute
   - Compare BPMN types with registered workers

4. **Verify against CAMUNDA_SPECIFICS.md**:
   - Are correct Zeebe namespaces used?
   - Is configuration compatible with Camunda 8?

## Reporting

Report:
- **Errors**: missing handlers, incorrect types
- **Warnings**: missing correlation keys, auto-generated IDs
- **Suggestions**: improvements, missing error handling
